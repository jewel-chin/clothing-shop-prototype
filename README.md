# Clothing Shop Prototype

This work was part of a web design assignment, where we were tasked with proposing and building a website of our choice, provided it met the minimum requirements: 
1. A fully responsive 5-page structure, with at least 3 distinct pages.
2.  **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap** as tech stack

--------

This project is a static website prototype built using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript**.

The main goal of this project was to conduct research and redesign a website that effectively reflects the brandâ€™s identity and mission.
For this project, I chose **Plop Apparels** as the brand to redesign.

The UI designs for this project were created in **Figma** before development. You can find the file `plop_figma.pdf` in the root directory of this project.

This project is deployed at https://jewel-chin.github.io/clothing-shop-prototype/
